Roadmap

In the coming weeks I plan to attach the google maps API. This will allow hosts to specify their listingsâ€™s location. Users will also be able to search based on location.

There will be a feature that allows users to write, edit and delete reviews

Users will be able to book appointments and see availability for each listing.
